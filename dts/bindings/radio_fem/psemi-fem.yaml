    This is a representation of the PSEMI Radio Front-End module.
    It is supplementing the generic representation of FEM with settling time and
    gain values appropriate for PSEMI device.

compatible: "psemi"

include: generic-fem-two-ctrl-pins.yaml

properties:
  att0-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
        SoC GPIO connected to the ATT0 input pin on the FEM device.

  att1-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
        SoC GPIO connected to the ATT1 input pin on the FEM device.

  att2-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
        SoC GPIO connected to the ATT2 input pin on the FEM device.

  att3-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
        SoC GPIO connected to the ATT3 input pin on the FEM device.

  antsel-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      description: |
          SoC GPIO connected to the Antenna Selection input pin on the FEM device.

  ctx-settle-time-us:
    type: int
    default: 23
    description: |
      Settling time in microseconds from activation of CTX to transmit.

      The default value is based on the experimentally determined settle
      time, that was observed on SKY66112-11 device.

  crx-settle-time-us:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Settling time in microseconds from activation of CRX to receive.

      The default value is based on the experimentally determined settle
      time, that was observed on SKY66112-11 device.
